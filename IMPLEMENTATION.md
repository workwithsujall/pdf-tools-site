# PDF Tools Implementation Summary

## Overview

This project implements a full-stack PDF manipulation web application with:
- React + Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- FastAPI Python backend for PDF processing

## Backend Implementation

### PDF Compression API

- Created using FastAPI to handle file uploads and processing
- Implemented PyMuPDF-based PDF compression with multiple compression levels
- Added background tasks for cleaning up temporary files
- Included file validation and error handling
- Set up proper CORS configuration for frontend communication

### API Structure

- `main.py` - FastAPI application with endpoints and error handling
- `pdf_utils.py` - PDF manipulation utilities using PyMuPDF
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies including FastAPI and PyMuPDF

## Frontend Integration

### PDF Service

Created a TypeScript service for communicating with the backend API:
- `compressPdf()` function for sending files to the backend
- `downloadBlob()` utility for downloading processed files
- Error handling and progress tracking

### Component Updates

Updated the frontend components to use real API processing:
- `FilePreview` component now handles both blob and URL formats
- `Home` page now processes PDFs using the backend API
- Added proper error handling and state management

## Deployment Configuration

Added Docker and Docker Compose configuration for easy deployment:
- Frontend container using Node.js
- Backend container with PyMuPDF dependencies
- Network configuration for service communication

## Next Steps

1. Implement additional PDF operations:
   - Merge PDFs
   - Split PDFs
   - Convert between formats

2. Add user features:
   - Authentication
   - Saved documents
   - Batch processing

3. Improve error handling:
   - Better error messages
   - Retries for failed operations
   - Logging

4. Performance optimizations:
   - Caching
   - Worker processes for handling large files
   - Progress streaming
